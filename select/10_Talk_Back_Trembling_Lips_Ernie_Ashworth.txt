Talk back trembling lips
Shakey legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's gettin' through to you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two
Everyday our love's a battle royal
It seems that fighting is all we do
But if I let you know how much I love you
You'll do things to me you shouldn't do
Talk back trembling lips
Shakey legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's gettin' through to you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two
Everytime you up and hurt my feelings
I pretend it couldn't matter less
I'm just hiding all of my emotions
Behind my broken heart I guess . . .so
Talk back trembling lips
Shakey legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's gettin' through to you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two
